### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics definitely did, a resourse i really loved was the doc file created by paige explaining react forms.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

Having more time I would have added a side bar that appends the favorites and likes upon that button being clicked, I would also like to use my trailer as a background upon opening my modal

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Something I really liked was Ian's favorite tabs i wasnt able to make mine as stretch but I would make sure to manage my time well and complete all my stretches next week
